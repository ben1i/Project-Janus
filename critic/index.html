            <h2 class="unfunny__title title">Suffering from being unfunny</h2>

            <p class="unfunny__paragraph paragraph">On the criticism side, Carson is often accused of not being funny—and that is somewhat true.</p>
            <p class="unfunny__paragraph paragraph">I’m not saying he is unfunny, but you have to be realistic: out of the few good jokes he makes, most of the humor comes from his friends or his community. It’s his reactions and his unusual laugh that make him seem funny.</p>
            <p class="unfunny__paragraph paragraph paragraph--bottom">However, this is a difficult thing to fix, as being funny is not something you can easily learn or change. It’s something that comes instinctively. I would suggest he take inspiration from his friends or community, even though that’s easier said than done.</p>

            <h3 class="critic__h3 critic__h3--grey">Carson has faced two controversies that shook his career.</h3>

            <div class="others__background background"></div>

            <h2 class="others__title title">How to destroy others’ reputation</h2>

            <p class="others__paragraph paragraph">The first controversy occurred in March 2020. At that time, Carson announced he was taking a break to focus on his mental health. He later revealed, in a Reddit comment, that the real reason for his break was that his ‘girlfriend’ at the time, Katerino, had cheated on him with another content creator, Fitz.</p>
            <p class="others__paragraph paragraph">The issue was that they were never really a couple. They met during a Twitch game show where a content creator seeks to find a girlfriend. For a few months after the show, they appeared on each other’s streams and acted like a couple, but they were not in an actual relationship. Carson’s Reddit comment spread across his community, leading fans to harass Katerino and Fitz on social media.</p>
            <p class="others__paragraph paragraph paragraph--bottom">Although all three of them apologized, the controversy effectively ended Katerino’s streaming career.</p>

            <div class="yourself__background background"></div>

            <h2 class="yourself__title title">How to destroy your reputation</h2>

            <p class="yourself__paragraph paragraph">Carson’s biggest controversy happened in January 2021 and nearly destroyed his own career.</p>
            <p class="yourself__paragraph paragraph">In January 2021, two of Carson’s friends appeared on the YouTube show “DramaAlert” and accused him of sexting an underage girl in 2019. At the time, he was 19, and she was 17. In the following days, other content creator friends confirmed the allegations and publicly cut ties with him. Photos of their conversations were shared online, and a second girl also accused Carson of sexting her when she was 17 and he was 20.</p>
            <p class="yourself__paragraph paragraph">Following the allegations, Carson disappeared from the Internet for eight months. During this time, he did not publish any videos and took down his subreddit and Discord server.</p>
            <p class="yourself__paragraph paragraph">On August 25, 2021, he released a video titled “Moving Forward,” in which he addressed his community about his plans moving forward. He stated that he had apologized privately to the victims and his former friends, and that he had seen a psychologist. Additionally, he announced that, for one year, he would donate all his earnings to charity, selecting a different charity each month.</p>
            <p class="yourself__paragraph paragraph paragraph--bottom">Since then, Carson has been mostly forgiven by the fans who stayed with him. However, his reputation online has taken a massive hit, with accusations of being a pedophile and groomer still surfacing occasionally. His former friends rarely mention him, and his current viewership numbers are far below what he achieved during his peak.</p>
